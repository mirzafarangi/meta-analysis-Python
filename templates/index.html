<h3>Meta-Analysis</h3>
<p> <b> Meta-analysis </b> is a quantitative, formal, epidemiological study design used to systematically assess previous research studies to derive conclusions about that body of research.</p>
<p>By pooling study-specific estimates of a common effect size and adjusting those estimates for sampling and measurement error, a meta-analyst can generate a weighted mean estimate of the effect size that normally reflects the true population effect size more accurately than any of the individual estimates on which it is based.</p>
        <h3>Why Meta-Mar?</h3>
        <p> <b>Meta-Mar</b> is a free online meta-analysis service which is developed for <a href="https://www.uni-marburg.de/fb04/team-christiansen/kj-pam">department of psychology in university of Marburg</a>, makes it possible to enter data directly or easily upload an already excisting Microsoft Excel spreadsheet in order to receive the results of the analysis. </p>
        <p>Facilities of this primary phase of the project include:
<ul class="a">
           <li>Calculation of the effect sizes based on Cohen'd and Hedges' g method for each single study.</li>
           <li>Calculate the overall effect size of the analysis.</li>
           <li> Drawing the Forest Plot of the analysis. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
      <p>Calculations are based on <b>sample sizes</b>, <b>means</b> and <b>standard deviations</b> of each study.</p>
      <p>In the second phase of the project, we will develope other calculations of the effect sizes such as <b>ratio odds</b>, <b>correlations</b> and <b>regressions</b>. </p>
